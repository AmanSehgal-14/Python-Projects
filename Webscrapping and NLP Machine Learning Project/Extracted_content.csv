review by prudence wade4 the chain the relationships that break us the women who rebuild us by chimene suleyman is published in hardback by wn available nowthe story of the chain is shocking made even worse in being a real story chimene suleymans memoir centres around a failed relationship with an ex which culminated with her getting an abortion and him brutally leaving her alone at the clinic as the story unfolds it turns out he was a pathological liar and manipulator and had treated scores more women in similarly horrific ways these women find each other through social media and as more details emerge of this unnamed mans behaviour the victims form a chain and find themselves bound together suleymans writing is personal and raw but once the initial bombshell settles theres not much direction to the book its a searing look at misogyny and the treatment of women but with a meandering and somewhat jumbled throughline it perhaps would have been better as an essay

blow the canadian comedian recounts of her toddler fredryan has three children  violet 14 from a previous relationship fred two and fenna 15 months with her childhood sweetheart and partner bobby kootstrafred is her most difficult child to wrangle at dinnertime and shes gone to desperate lengths just to get him to try her foodive made a deal with him  ive said you can taste it and if you want to spit it out youre allowed and you wont be in trouble just put it in your mouth and taste it and see if you like it then hell be like ok and hell allow himself to take a bite and even if he spits it out everyone in the kitchen goes really well done fred wow great did you see how fred tried that that was really coolso basically im raising a toxic male and rewarding him for absolutely nothing ryan jokesshe adds freds taught me a lot about life about men about myself londonbased ryan had her first child when she was 25 and says having two more over a decade later was a completely different experiencenow shes 40 she admits to having less energy than before but adds ive learned this time that every child is so different and you have to reserve your judgement violet just happened to be this wonderful amenable happy all the time and do whatever i said and eat whatever i fed her type of childand then my son came along and fred is a tricky customer  he is such a fussy eater and such a highmaintenance guy in general that i have had to pivot a bit as a parent especially at mealtimesand thats not the only thing that changed for ryani have a husband now so its not just all up to me my husband is such a softy and he will feed fred pasta for breakfast lunch and dinner because thats what fred wants but i really have to dig my heels in and be like no thats not appropriate at some point we need to offer him other sources of nutrition and branch him outwhen it was just ryan and violet she says we were eating out a lot or i was getting takeaway a lot and i wasnt proud of that it didnt make me feel confident that my daughter was getting the right kind of nutrition that i was getting the right kind of nutrition our choices were really limitedespecially around 2019 when my husband came into our lives and my daughter started to get bigger and be able to cook herself i really wanted to prioritise family mealtimesinitially the two younger kids were eating around five violet would eat on her own when she got back from school and social commitments and ryan and kootstra would finally have dinner around 930pm which is a really unacceptable time to eat unless you are europeanryan worried that violet was missing out on really useful essential conversation that accidentally comes out around the dinner table so now the schedule has changed a bit particularly as the family uses gousto recipe boxestheyre now making dinner just the once  when violet is home she sits down with her brother and sister and eats at five when shes not home we have dinner already ready so well sit with her for a bit before we do bedtime bathtime and then weve eaten ourselvesi think in the modern world we lose sight of how important it is to have a traditional family dinnertimeryan says goustos new blueyinspired range of meal boxes helps cut through the chaos of dinnertime engaging the little ones in what theyre eating  particularly as theyre superfans of the cbeebies showinvolving fred in the preparation of meals is what helps him feel safer about trying a variety of food ryan explains  and some of the meals shell dress up for adults later for example adding pine nuts to a cheesy asparagus and tomato orzo dish it means we dont have to make dinner three separate times and dirty every pot in the kitchenultimately her advice for parents is simple keep as calm as possiblewere all doing our best especially when youre juggling children and your relationship and your time for selfcare and work i am not under any delusions that my job is a job  i know people have it a lot harder than i doparticularly around feeding kids all you can do is your bestbut if it doesnt go your way dont stress  because i have put my kids to bed without dinner not by choice but just because they wouldnt eat something ive offered them a few snacks and they still drink milk and they still keep growingso worstcase scenario toddlers seem to be able to exist on a pack of raisins a day  dont stress if theyre not eating because that will make them more stressed i think its great to offer a variety of healthful delicious options then if they dont want it if you have a meltdown  theyre definitely not going to want it the next timemy only advice to parents is to stay as calm as you can as often as you cangousto ambassador comedian and blueysuperfan katherine ryan is celebrating the launch of

company messages seen by reutersthe carmaker will continue developing selfdriving robotaxis on the same smallvehicle platform the sources saidthe decision represents an abandonment of a longstanding goal that tesla chief elon musk has often characterised as its primary mission affordable electric cars for the masses his first master plan for the company in 2006 called for manufacturing luxury models first then using the profits to finance a lowcost family cartesla shares were down by 6 per cent in late morning trading after the reportmusk has since repeatedly promised such a vehicle to investors and consumers as recently as january musk told investors that tesla planned to start production of the affordable model at its texas factory in the second half of 2025teslas cheapest current model the model 3 saloon retails for about 39000 36000 in the united states the nowdefunct entrylevel vehicle sometimes described in media reports as the model 2 was expected to start at about 25000 23000tesla did not respond to requests for commentthe stark reversal comes as tesla faces fierce competition globally from chinese electricvehicle makers flooding the market with cars priced as low as 10000 the plan for driverless robotaxis which could take longer to deliver presents a stiffer engineering challenge and more regulatory risktwo sources said they learned of teslas decision to scrap the model 2 in a meeting attended by scores of employees with one of them saying the gathering happened in late februaryelons directive is to go all in on robotaxi that person saidthe third source confirmed the cancellation and said new plans call for robotaxis to be produced but in much lower volumes than had been projected for the model 2several company messages about the decision included one on march 1st from an unnamed programme manager for the affordable car discussing the projects demise with engineering staff and advising them to hold off on telling suppliers about program cancellationa fourth person with knowledge of teslas plans expressed optimism about the decision to pivot away from the cheapcar strategy in favour of robotaxis a segment musk has envisioned as the future of mobility the source cautioned that teslas product plans could change again based on economic conditionssqueezing profits from entrylevel vehicles is a challenge for any carmaker but teslas delay in pursuing the car musk once called his dream made it much tougher because it now faces far more competition in that price rangewhile tesla spent years developing its highly experimental cybertruck a pricey electric pickup chinese carmakers have raced ahead on affordable evs grabbing market share gaining economies of scale and offering consumers bargain prices that western carmakers are struggling to matchas chinese evs surged to challenge teslas dominance musk was tending to his sprawling empire which includes rocketmaker spacex brainchip developer neuralink and social media giant x which musk acquired in 2022 formerly called twitter the platform has foundered under musks volatile management shedding most of its value as the company has lost revenue and advertisersplans for the affordable tesla have been seen as key to delivering on musks stratospheric ambitions for sales growth musk said in 2020 that tesla aspired by 2030 to sell 20 million vehicles  twice as many as the worlds largest automaker toyota sells today with the death of the model 2 its unclear how hell get thereexpectations for a 25000 vehicle have underpinned wall street analysts more modest but still ambitious forecasts for tesla sales those forecasts according to a tesla investorrelations document call for vehicle sales rising to 42 million by 2028 from 18 million last yearmusk has wavered on the project before in a biography of the entrepreneur released last year author walter issacson reported that musk in 2022 put a hold on the entrylevel ev plans reasoning that a tesla robotaxi would make the car irrelevant musks advisors urged him to stay the course the book saidtesla called the affordablecar project nv91 internally and h422 externally when discussing it with suppliers according to two of the sources and company messages reviewed by reutersmessages from the unnamed tesla programme manager to staffers referenced those code names in discussing the projects termination one of those messages sent march 1st said that suppliers should halt all further activities related to h422nv91the sources said they did not know all the reasons behind the decision to kill the projectthe affordablecar projects cancellation comes as tesla and other established automakers have been rocked by slowing ev demand growth in the united states and europe and cutthroat competition in chinaif tesla had moved forward with the lowcost car it wouldnt have arrived on the market until the latter half of 2025 by the companys estimate but the entrylevel ev segment is already crowded with compelling models from byd and many other chinese brands  reuters,Business

65,minister for the environment and transport eamon ryan has said that he does not envisage congestion charges being introduced in the near futureif we try to price people off the road that wouldnt work it wouldnt be socially just it would be very expensive on the motorist i dont think thats the best way to go he told rté radios morning irelandi think the best way to go is to reallocate the road space so you have a really effective public transport system and give the space for the cyclists and pedestrians that allocation of space rather than price people off the road i think its the first step on the way to gomr ryan said that government plans were about making the transport system work for everyone having an effective transport system was also part of the climate solution to reduce the use of cars and stop burning fossil fuelspart of that will be also shifting towards public transport towards safer walking active cycling and other modes and its a medium to long term strategymr ryan has said the new strategy moving together was about making transport work for everyone and it was not antimotorist or carsthe strategy does put a lot of choice on local authorities he acknowledgedits not forcing and things not making a major decisions its not putting an immediate charge on anything but it does recognise that the current system because it is so gridlocked in ireland weve had a car dependent system for 60 or 70 years weve reached the end of the road to that and we do need to change direction but also we do need to address climate changemr ryan said that strategy did not want to shame or price people off the road it was aimed at providing better quicker transport alternatives rural bus services are taking off in this country and the public are responding in incredible wayif car traffic could be reduced it would give more road space and allow buses to move faster and more efficientlyif we can reduce the traffic and give the road space so the bus goes quicker that works better for everyone people can switch which they want to do onto public transport you have less cars less gridlock less emissionsits a switch of direction away from ever lengthening commutes ever longer commutes towards planning our country planning our towns and cities so its easier to get around so that the shorter distances so that we really clever how we manage transport thats with this planwhen asked about penalties for local authorities that do not implement the transport strategy mr ryan said the main penalty would be that they would miss out on the budget that will be allocated to improving transport services the better bus systems the better active travel networks obviously thats where the money is going to go tothe timeline for the strategy is that it first go to public consultation he explained this will allow times for the public and councils to respond the aim is to listen and respond because this cant be forced it cant be punitiveit has to be a recognition that by switching away from a system which is gridlocked congested polluting with high accidents towards one which is much more social which is much much more effective transport system its thats positive change we need to makeweve reached the end of the road on a car dominated just more and more and more and more traffic will not work for our country so first thing is we have to consult and listen to other people there are measures that will come in quickly but the majority of this is for the coming next two five ten yearsthe job of politics was to persuade he said change was never easy especially when it came to transport as car dependency was embedded in planning over the yearsweve allowed the sprawl of our cities weve allowed corrupt rezoning to actually create a car dependent system and thats hard to undo and thats why its cant be a punitive response it has to be a progressive better alternative response so it does take time,Ireland

from clane in co kildare has lived in the landlocked country in the southeast of africa with his family for the past few yearsas the small poor country grapples with an increase in major disaster events such as cyclones and flooding mr kelly said there was a need for more empathy towards people vulnerable to climate challengescyclone idai happened pretty much when i arrived in 2019 the programmes manager in malawi for irish charity trocaire said of the seconddeadliest tropical cyclone to hit the southern hemispherethe evidence is clear  climate change is impacting malawi he told the pa news agencythey are one of the top 10 countries who have been impacted by climate change and that will only continue to get worse unless action is taken unless we all take actionaround three quarters of malawis 21 million strong population rely on agriculture meaning if crops fail people go hungryover four million people are food insecure in malawi according to its government and depending on the harvest yield in the next few months this could double to eight millionmr kelly said some climate change related events in europe such as the 2021 floods in germany and forest fires in portugal last year have helped to turn the needle on how climate change is viewed in the global northhe added i think if there was one million people food insecure in ireland i think youd see a lot of action being taken then while the fact that people are food insecure in malawi due to climate change maybe it doesnt bring about the action as quicklychanging weather patterns have also made it difficult for malawian farmers who mostly grow the food that they eat to know when to farmlast year the deadly and powerful cyclone freddy flooded the south of the country and a drought hit the north but this year the south had dry spells in february at a crucial time during the rainy seasonits much much much much much harder for communities to know what the weather will be  when the rains will start when they will end how consistent they will be mr kelly saidbefore times were tough but at least you knew with more certainty when the rains would start and when they will finish but now its so much more difficultfarmer malita mussa is a single motherofsix who lives in the machinga district in southern malawishe said that her maize crop yield last year was a bit off but this year it is expected to be much worsei expect to harvest one bag while in the previous years i would have got six bags malita said speaking through an interpretermalita who has four children still living at home

who are also farmers in ireland im in deep pain and really worried due to reduced yields and dry spellsi wonder if they could manage and cope with the climate change effects as well as i haveif they could withstand the kind of weather patterns that i face in my communityshe said that she employs good farming practices diversifying her crops so that her family have an alternative if the main ones are badly affected speaking through an interpreter she added im urging farmers that they should take part and they should adapti am encouraging the farmers in ireland to adapt to the new practices so that they all fight together in reducing climate changeduring the rainy season malitas village is surrounded by the deep green hues of the mountains maize and rice fields and banana mango and guava treesbut at the end of this years rainy season the fields are pockmarked by wilting cropsthe beautiful remoteness of the village also causes its problems  after cyclone freddy hit in march last year

also making it more difficult for people to remain in their hometowns while expanding lakes and rivers from flooding mean farmers have lost landas temperatures rise in the south of the country in its fourth biggest city and former capital zomba malaria is spreading more regularly than beforein a way its an existential threat to certain areas of southern malawi because if rising temperatures continue people will not be able to live in those areas mr kelly saidso the people in nsanje and chikwawa that we are working with if temperatures continue to rise itll just be too hot for people to live there they wont be able to live where they lived for the whole of their livespeople moving from their hometowns because of climate change is inevitable said peter chimangeni of malawis department

even gods doing she said she believes some things are humans handiworkpeople might say climate change is gods doing she said speaking through an interpreterbut for me no sometimes its our handwork

79,a high court judge has found that levels of noise generated at certain times of the day by a wind farm constitutes a nuisance to the occupants of neighbouring propertiesin a landmark decision which is understood to have implications for the operation of electricitygenerating wind turbines ms justice emily egan held that noise levels from the twoturbine ballyduff windfarm at kilcomb near enniscorthy co wexford amounted to unreasonable interferencethe cases are the first private nuisance claim from wind turbine noise to run in either ireland or the uk the judge saidthe first action was taken by margret webster and her partner keith rollo whose home is close to the wind farm which has been operational since 2017a second action was taken by ross shorten and joan carty who had owned another property close to the turbines but sold it after they commenced their proceedings in 2018both couples had sued the wind farm operator meenacloghspar wind limited seeking damages for nuisancethe couples claimed they had been subjected to constant noise and nuisance from the wind farm that had damaged their lives health and the value of the propertiesthe claims were fully denied by the defendant with a registered address at stillorgan road donnybrook dublin 4in her ruling on the first part of the case which dealt with liability only ms justice egan said the noise amounted to an unreasonable interference with the enjoyment of their property and they were therefore entitled to damagesthe hearing of the first module lasted for 51 days far longer than what had been originally estimated by the parties lawyers the judge notedthe costs of the case to date have been estimated to be well over 1 millionduring the course of the hearing the judge also physically visited the turbines and the propertiesgiving the courts decision the judge said that there are frequent and sustained periods of noise widely acknowledged to be associated with high levels of annoyance and have a characteristic known to lead to adverse reaction in the communitythe judge accepted that in this case such noise levels from the wind farm occurs commonly and for sustained periodsnoise levels that exhibit these characteristics on a regular and sustained basis were unreasonable and exceptional she saidi find that the plaintiffs complaints are objectively justified in that the noise interferes with the ordinary comfort and enjoyment of their homes when it occurs this interference is a substantial interferencewhile the noise is liable to annoy during the working day higher prevailing background noise levels and the fact that the occupants are not trying to relax or sleep means that the noise did not in general substantially interfere with the plaintiffs enjoyment of their property she saidhowever the noise poses a nuisance to the plaintiffs in the evenings and at weekends when one could reasonably expect to be enjoying recreation in the garden or peace in ones dwellingdemonstrably the noise also poses a nuisance at night and in the early morning when a quiet environment is at a premium she saidthe amount of damages to be awarded to the plaintiffs the issue of whether an injunction ought to be granted and if so the terms of such injunction will be assessed by the court following the second module of the claimthe judge also found that the defendant had not breached the terms of turbines planning permission as allegedthe court said that while the court was not satisfied that wind farm complies with the noise condition of its permission this had not been pleaded in the casethe court also rejected claims that the defendant had been negligent towards the plaintiffsthe court rejected the defendants claim that mr shorten and ms carty were not entitled to seek damages for arising out of their disposal of their former propertythe judge said they were entitled to advance a claim to damages in nuisance for any unreasonable interference with amenity occasioned during the period of their ownership and potentially for diminution in the sale pricethe judge said the case was before the court when existing planning guidance regulating the noise aspects of wind farm developments in ireland the wind energy development guidelines 2006 are under reviewwhile draft revised wind energy development guidelines were published in 2019 these had been withdrawn the judge saidin the absence of clear policy guidance from the government on wind turbine noise the assessment in an individual case is a classic matter of degree on which the court must exercise judgment the judge addedafter giving her decision the judge directed the parties to reengage in mediation in an attempt to identify appropriate and proportionate mitigation measuresthe judge said she was requesting this in an attempt to resolve all outstanding issues between themin their actions the plaintiffs sought various orders requiring the defendant to cease operating decommission and dismantle the wind farmthey also sought orders restraining the defendant from operating the wind farm until it is constructed in a way such as to not cause undue and excessive noise vibration and shadow flicker at their homethey further sought damages including aggravated damages for nuisance negligence breach of duty and breach of their constitutional rights including their rights to family life and the quiet enjoyment of their homethe couples represented in the action by john rogers sc instructed by solicitor philip coffey of noonan linehan carroll coffey claimed their lives suffered due to the impact of the noise vibration and shadow flicker from the wind farmtheir sleep had been disrupted their anxiety levels increased and their overall mental health had suffered due to the noise and vibrations generated by the wind farmthey said the noise was like a cement mixer or an aeroplane flying overhead without ever landingmr shorten and ms carty with an address at grange road rathfarnham dublin 14 had claimed that their former house at ballyduff was approximately 359 metres from the wind farmafter delivering her decision the judge agreed to adjourn the matter

steps to increase aid flows to gaza including opening the ashdod port and the erez crossing into northern gaza and increasing aid deliveries from jordan it was not clear if the steps would be enough to satisfy us demandsthe turning point for mr biden an ardent supporter of israel was mondays deadly israeli attack on the workers from celebrity chef jose andres wck charity groupit came as the biden administration has been stepping up pressure on israel to consider alternatives to a threatened ground offensive in the southern gaza city of rafah the last relatively safe haven for civilians in the coastal enclavespeaking on condition of anonymity a source familiar with the talks said the 30minute call was at times tense with mr biden spelling out his concerns and netanyahu defending his approach on gazaa senior white house official described the conversation as very direct very straightforward saying it included vice president kamala harris national security adviser jake sullivan and mr blinkenas to what the united states expects the official said we need a comprehensive plan on them doing a much better job here they cant be killing humanitarian aid workers and civilianswhile mr biden has long avoided curtailing us support for israel he may finally have reached his limitthere was always going to be a point at which the biden administration felt that the domestic and international cost of supporting israels campaign in gaza outweighed the benefit of what israel was able to achieve on the ground said mike singh a former national security council official on the middle eastwhat is remarkable is not that this is happening but that it took so longmr singh now at the washington institute for near east policy said if israel did not meet mr bidens conditions the likeliest step was the us negotiating a un security council resolution like the one that ended the 2006 israelhezbollah conflictplacing conditions on arms transfers is more fraught politically would likely face stiff opposition on capitol hill and could leave israel vulnerable to attack by hezbollah or other iranian proxies he addedstill mr biden may have telegraphed his thinking last month when after saying a rafah invasion would be a red line he said he would never cut off all weapons so that they dont have the iron dome missile defense system to protect themhe did not explicitly make such assurances about offensive weapons fuelling speculation he could impose conditions on such arms transfers to israel which relies heavily on us armsjonathan panikoff a former deputy national intelligence officer on the middle east said mr biden was unlikely to take drastic action upending usisraeli ties such as withholding bigticket weapons or completely abandoning israel at the unbut he could put conditions on smaller military items and take further measures against extremist jewish settlers involved in attacks on palestinians in the occupied west bankbidens frustration with how the war is being conducted and with prime minister netanyahu himself has reached an apex mr panikoff said,World
87,the israeli military said on friday that it has dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others for their roles in drone strikes in gaza that killed seven aid workers on a fooddelivery missionit said they had mishandled critical information and violated the armys rules of engagementthe findings of a retired generals investigation into the killings marked an embarrassing admission by israel which faces growing accusations from key allies including the us of not doing enough to protect gazas civilians from its war with hamasthe findings are likely to renew scepticism over the israeli militarys decisionmakingpalestinians aid groups and human rights organisations have repeatedly accused israeli forces of firing recklessly at civilians throughout the conflict a charge israel deniesits a tragedy the militarys spokesperson rear admiral daniel hagari told reportersits a serious event that we are responsible for and it shouldnt have happened and we will make sure that it wont happen againwith pressure mounting on israel to hold itself accountable hagari and other officials gave reporters the results of the militarys uncommonly speedy and detailed investigationit was unclear whether the punishments and the apology would calm an international outcry over the deaths of the world central kitchen workers or reassure international aid groups that it was safe to resume operations in gaza where nearly a third of the population is on the brink of starvationaccording to what spokespeople said were the israeli armys rules targets must be visually identified as threats for multiple reasons before they can be hitbut the investigation determined that a colonel had authorised the series of deadly drone strikes on the convoy based on one majors observation from grainy dronecamera footage that someone in the convoy was armedthat observation turned out to be untrue military officials saidthe army said the colonel and the major were dismissed while three other officers were reprimandedit said the results of its investigation were turned over to the militarys advocate general who will decide whether the officers or anyone else involved in the killings should receive further punishment or be prosecutedthe strike on the aid vehicles is a grave mistake stemming from a serious failure due to a mistaken identification errors in decisionmaking and an attack contrary to the standard operating procedures the army said in a statement when it released the findingsthe killings were condemned by israels closest allies and renewed criticism of israels conduct in the nearly sixmonth war with hamasthe aid workers were three british citizens a polish citizen an australian and a canadian american dual citizen all of whom worked for world central kitchen the international charity founded by celebrity chef jose andres their palestinian driver also was killed the investigation found two major areas of wrongdoingit faulted officers for failing to read messages alerting troops that cars not aid trucks would carry workers from the charity away from the warehouse where aid was distributedas a result the cars that were targeted were misidentified as transporting militantsthe army also faulted a major who identified the strike target and a colonel who approved the strike for acting with insufficient informationthe army said the order was given after one of the passengers inside a car was identified as a gunmanit said troops became suspicious because a gunman had been seen on the roof of one of the delivery trucks on the way to the warehousethe army showed reporters footage of the gunman firing his weapon while riding on top of one of the trucksafter the aid was dropped off at a warehouse an officer believed he had spotted a gunman in one of the carsthe passenger it turned out was not carrying a weapon  the military said it is possible he was just carrying a bagthe army said it initially hit one car as people scrambled away into a second car it hit that vehicle as wellit did the same thing when survivors scrambled into a third cararmy officials claimed that drone operators could not see that the cars were marked with the words world central kitchen because it was nightthe army could not say exactly where the communication about the convoys plans had broken downthe army declined to answer questions about whether similar violations of rules of engagement have taken place during the war in which palestinians aid workers and international rights groups have repeatedly accused the army of recklessly striking civiliansthe investigation was headed by yoav hareven a retired generalthe seven who were killed were distributing food that had been taken into gaza through a newly established maritime corridorworld central kitchen said it had coordinated its movements with the military and that the vehicles were marked with the organisations logoit was a direct attack on clearly marked vehicles
